                    <div>An ever - evolving field like education, each learner has to learn more to stay relevant as they have access to better tools and more knowledge.
                        Covid induced pandemic has made, newer learning methods that are less tedius, engaging, interactive and more pleasant, an absolute necessity.
                        Numerous studies have supported the efficacy of quiz based learnings. <br /><br />
                        The effectiveness of quiz - based learning is rooted in following key aspects:- <br /> <br />
                        <b>Engagement:- </b>Quizes helps in engagement, which in turn helps increase the time spent on learning from the application. Moreover, as playing a quiz doesnâ€™t seem like studying, learners involve more in their free time or to unwind, thereby adding to their learning time in a day.
                        <br /> <br />
                        <b>Retention:- </b> Participating in quizes creates memory traces, which can influence learning outcomes in the short term. As digital quizes can be participated more than one time and repeated retrieval of these memory traces during practice leads to long - term retention of the subject.
                        <br /> <br />
                        <b>Comprehension:- </b> Digitally designed quizzes improve the process of learning through instant feedback, explanations for incorrect answers, further helping in comprehension, memorisation and recall.
                        <br /> <br />
                        <b>More Fun:- </b>Quizes are fun way of learning a subject.
