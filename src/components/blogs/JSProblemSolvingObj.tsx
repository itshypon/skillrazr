      JavaScript objects are used to represent and organize data in a structured
      manner. They are typically used when you have a set of related data that
      you want to store and manipulate as a single unit. Objects in JavaScript
      allow you to group related data and functions together, making it easier
      to work with that data. Here are some common scenarios where you might use
      JavaScript objects: Storing and manipulating data: Objects are useful for
      storing data that is related to each other, such as user information or
      product details. Representing real-world objects: Objects can be used to
      represent real-world objects, such as a car or a person. For example, you
      could create an object to represent a car, with properties like make,
      model, and color, and methods like start and stop. Organizing code:
      Objects can be used to organize code into more manageable pieces. You can
      group related functions and data into an object, making it easier to
      understand and maintain your code. Communicating with APIs: Objects are
      often used to communicate with APIs, which typically return data in JSON
      format. You can use JavaScript objects to parse and manipulate this data
      in your application.
      <li>
        <b> Reverse Object:</b> Write a function that takes an object as input
        and returns a new object with the keys and values reversed.
      </li>
      <li>
        {" "}
        <b> Merge Objects: </b> Write a function that takes two objects as input
        and returns a new object that is the combination of the two input
        objects.
      </li>
    </div>
