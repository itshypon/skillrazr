        <h1 className="text-3xl py-5">Know English Grammar</h1>
        You just need to know basic high school grammar to start with. Without
        correct grammar it's difficult to form the sentences and communicate{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Here are some basic and important grammar rules that are often taught in
        high school. <br />
        <br />
        1) Subject-verb agreement: The verb in a sentence must agree with the
        subject in number (singular or plural). For example, "She plays the
        piano." <br />
        <br />
        2) Pronoun-antecedent agreement: A pronoun must agree with the noun it
        refers to (its antecedent) in number and gender. For example, "Everyone
        in the class handed in their assignments on time." <br />
        <br />
        3) Proper verb tense: It is important to use the correct verb tense to
        convey the time frame of the action being described. For example, "She
        is studying for her exams." (present tense) or "She studied for her
        exams." (past tense)
        <br />
        <br />
        4) Proper use of adjectives and adverbs: Adjectives describe nouns and
        pronouns, while adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.
        It is important to use these words correctly in order to accurately
        describe things. <br />
        <br />
        5) Proper use of prepositions: Prepositions are words that show the
        relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence.
        For example, "The book is on the table."
        <br />
        <br />
        6) Proper use of conjunctions: Conjunctions are words that join clauses
        or phrases. For example, "I will go to the store, but I need to finish
        my homework first." <br />
        <br />
        7) Proper use of interjections: Interjections are words or phrases that
        are used to express strong emotions or to show surprise. For example,
        "Oh no! I forgot my keys!" By understanding and following these basic
        grammar rules, you will be well on your way to improving your English
        communication skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        8) You also need to know about using tenses, passive voices, modal
        verbs, reported speech and phrasal verbs <br />
        <br />
        Some of the topics explained in detail below. <br />

      <div>
        <b> Nouns :- </b> Nouns are words that represent people, places, things,
        or ideas. <br />
        <br /> Some examples of nouns include "dog," "Paris," "happiness," and
        "teacher." Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns in a
        sentence. Some examples of pronouns include "I," "me," "you," "he,"
        "she," "it," "we," "they," and "them." There are several types of nouns
        and pronouns in English, including: <br />
        <br /> Common nouns: These are general nouns that do not refer to
        specific people, places, or things. For example: "dog," "city,"
        "happiness." <br />
        <br /> Proper nouns: These are specific nouns that refer to a particular
        person, place, or thing. Proper nouns are always capitalized. For
        example: "Paris," "John," "Monday." <br />
        <br /> Concrete nouns: These are nouns that refer to things that can be
        perceived by the five senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell).
        For example: "dog," "table," "scent." Abstract nouns: These are nouns
        that refer to intangible things, such as ideas, emotions, or qualities.
        For example: "happiness," "love," "intelligence." <br />
        <br /> Personal pronouns: These pronouns refer to specific people or
        things and change form depending on the person speaking and the person
        being spoken to. For example: "I," "you," "he," "she," "it," "we,"
        "they." <br />
        <br /> Possessive pronouns: These pronouns show ownership or possession.
        For example: "my," "your," "his," "her," "its," "our," "their." By
        understanding and using nouns and pronouns correctly, you can improve
        the clarity and effectiveness of your communication in English. <br />
        <br /> <br />
        <br />
        <b>Adjectives:- </b>Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns
        or pronouns. They help to provide more information about the noun or
        pronoun and make the meaning of a sentence more specific. For example:
        "I saw a large dog." (The adjective "large" describes the noun "dog.")
        "She is a kind person." (The adjective "kind" describes the noun
        "person.") <br />
        <br /> Adjectives can be used to describe characteristics of a noun,
        such as its size, shape, color, age, or personality. Adjectives can also
        describe the quantity or quality of a noun. For example: "I have a small
        car." (The adjective "small" describes the size of the noun "car.") "The
        red dress is beautiful." (The adjective "red" describes the color of the
        noun "dress," and the adjective "beautiful" describes the quality of the
        noun "dress.") <br />
        <br /> There are several types of adjectives in English, including:
        Descriptive adjectives: These adjectives describe the characteristics of
        a noun or pronoun. For example: "happy," "large," "red," "old." <br />
        <br /> Quantitative adjectives: These adjectives describe the quantity
        or amount of a noun or pronoun. For example: "some," "many," "few,"
        "all." <br />
        <br /> Demonstrative adjectives: These adjectives show which noun or
        pronoun is being referred to. For example: "this," "that," "these,"
        "those." <br />
        <br /> Possessive adjectives: These adjectives show ownership or
        possession. For example: "my," "your," "his," "her," "its," "our,"
        "their." <br />
        <br /> By understanding and using adjectives correctly, you can add more
        description and detail to your writing and speaking in English.

      <div>
        <b>Tenses :- </b>There are three main verb tenses in English: past,
        present, and future. <br />
        <br />
        The past tense is used to describe events that have already happened.
        For example, "I went to the store yesterday." <br />
        <br /> The present tense is used to describe events that are happening
        now. For example, "I am going to the store now." <br />
        <br />
        The future tense is used to describe events that will happen in the
        future. For example, "I will go to the store tomorrow." <br />
        <br />
        Within each of these tenses, there are four main verb forms: <br />
        <br />
        Simple: This form is used to describe an action that is happening or
        will happen. For example, "I walk to work every day." (present simple)
        or "I walked to work yesterday." (past simple) <br />
        <br />
        Continuous: This form is used to describe an action that is in progress
        at the time of speaking. For example, "I am walking to work now."
        (present continuous) or "I was walking to work when I saw a dog." (past
        continuous) <br />
        <br />
        Perfect: This form is used to describe an action that was completed
        before a certain point in time. For example, "I have finished my
        homework." (present perfect) or "I had finished my homework before I
        watched TV." (past perfect) <br />
        <br />
        Perfect continuous: This form is used to describe an action that was in
        progress over a period of time and was recently completed. For example,
        "I have been waiting for the bus for half an hour." (present perfect
        continuous) or "I had been waiting for the bus for half an hour before
        it finally arrived." (past perfect continuous) <br />
        <br />
        By understanding and using these verb forms correctly, you can
        communicate effectively in English and express a wide range of actions
        and events.

        <b>Passive voices :- </b> In English, the active voice and the passive
        voice are two different ways of constructing a sentence. <br />
        <br />
        In the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action.
        For example: "The cat chased the mouse." In this sentence, the subject
        is "the cat" and the action is "chased." <br />
        <br />
        In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon. For
        example: "The mouse was chased by the cat." In this sentence, the
        subject is "the mouse" and the action, "chased," is being performed on
        the subject. <br />
        <br />
        The active voice is generally more direct and easier to understand than
        the passive voice. However, the passive voice can be useful in certain
        situations, such as when the identity of the subject is unknown or
        unimportant, or when you want to emphasize the action or the object of
        the sentence. <br />
        <br />
        Here are some tips for using the active and passive voice correctly:{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Use the active voice when the subject of the sentence is performing the
        action. Use the passive voice when the subject of the sentence is being
        acted upon. Avoid using the passive voice too frequently, as it can make
        your writing sound passive and indirect. <br />
        <br />
        By understanding and using the active and passive voices correctly, you
        can improve the clarity and effectiveness of your writing.

        <b>Modal verbs :-</b> In English grammar, modal verbs are auxiliary
        verbs that are used to express various kinds of necessity, possibility,
        and permission. <br />
        <br />
        Some common modal verbs include "can," "could," "may," "might," "must,"
        "shall," "should," "will," and "would." Modal verbs are different from
        other verbs in a few ways: They do not have a past tense form. For
        example, "I can swim" (present tense), not "I could swim" (past tense).
        <br />
        <br />
        They are followed by the base form of the verb (also known as the
        infinitive form without "to"). For example, "I must go" (not "I must to
        go"), "She can swim" (not "She can to swim"). <br />
        <br />
        They do not have a third person singular form (no -s ending). For
        example, "He can swim" (not "He cans swim"), "She must go" (not "She
        musts go"). <br />
        <br />
        Here are some examples of how modal verbs are used: <br />
        <br />
        To express ability: "I can speak French." To express possibility: "It
        may rain tomorrow."
        <br />
        <br />
        To express permission: "You can borrow my umbrella." <br />
        <br />
        To express necessity or obligation: "I must finish my homework." <br />
        <br />
        To express advice or suggestion: "You should see a doctor." <br />
        <br />
        By understanding and using modal verbs correctly, you can improve the
        clarity and effectiveness of your communication in English.

        <b>Reported speech :-</b> Reported speech, also known as indirect
        speech, is a way of repeating or paraphrasing what someone else has
        said. <br />
        <br />
        It is used to report or convey information without directly quoting the
        words of the original speaker. <br />
        <br />
        In reported speech, the tense of the verb usually changes to reflect the
        fact that the statement is being reported, rather than spoken directly.
        For example: Direct speech: "I am going to the store," she said.
        Reported speech: She said that she was going to the store. <br />
        <br />
        Here are some tips for using reported speech correctly: <br />
        <br />
        Use the past tense to report something that was said in the past. For
        example: "She said that she was tired." Change the pronoun and verb
        tense as needed to reflect the fact that the statement is being
        reported. <br />
        <br />
        For example: "I am going to the store," she said. becomes "She said that
        she was going to the store." Use "that" to introduce the reported
        statement. <br />
        <br />
        For example: "She said that she was going to the store." Use "said" to
        introduce the quote, unless the original speaker used a different verb
        of speaking (e.g., "asked," "replied," etc.).
        <br />
        <br /> By using reported speech correctly, you can effectively convey
        information without directly quoting the words of the original speaker.

      <div>
        <b>Phrasal verbs :-</b> Phrasal verbs are verbs that are made up of a
        verb and one or more particles (such as "up," "off," "away," etc.).{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Phrasal verbs can have different meanings from the base verb on its own,
        and they are often used in spoken English. <br />
        <br />
        Here are some examples of phrasal verbs and their meanings: "Turn off"
        (separate or stop): "Can you turn off the TV?" "Turn down" (reduce or
        reject): "I turned down the job offer." "Look up" (search or check): "I
        need to look up the word in the dictionary." "Look after" (take care
        of): "Can you look after my cat while I'm on vacation?" <br />
        <br />
        It is important to note that phrasal verbs can be separated by an object
        (a noun or pronoun). For example: "Turn the TV off." (separate or stop)
        "I turned the job offer down." (reject) "I need to look the word up in
        the dictionary." (search or check) "Can you look my cat after while I'm
        on vacation?" (take care of) <br />
        <br />
        By understanding and using phrasal verbs correctly, you can improve your
        fluency and comprehension in spoken English.
